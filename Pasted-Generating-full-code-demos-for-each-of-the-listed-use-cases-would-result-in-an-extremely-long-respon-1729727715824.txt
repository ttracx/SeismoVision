Generating full code demos for each of the listed use cases would result in an extremely long response. However, I can provide code examples for some key use cases to illustrate how AI can be applied in the Oil and Gas industry. Below are code demos for selected applications:

1. Seismic Data Interpretation

Use Case: AI algorithms process and interpret large volumes of seismic data to identify potential oil and gas reservoirs.

Code Demo: Seismic Data Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load seismic data (Assuming data is in NumPy array format)
# seismic_data.npy contains seismic images
# labels.npy contains labels indicating presence of oil/gas reservoirs
X = np.load('seismic_data.npy')
y = np.load('labels.npy')

# Preprocess data
X = X / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
y = to_categorical(y)  # Convert labels to one-hot encoding

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2], X.shape[3])),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(y.shape[1], activation='softmax')
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

# Predict on new data
# new_seismic_data.npy contains new seismic images for prediction
new_data = np.load('new_seismic_data.npy') / 255.0

data = pd.read_csv('maintenance_data.csv')

# Feature selection
features = data.drop('failure', axis=1)
labels = data['failure']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

feature_names = features.columns
feature_importance_df = pd.DataFrame({'feature': feature_names, 'importance': importances})
print(feature_importance_df.sort_values(by='importance', ascending=False))

Explanation:

    # This is a simplified example
    return np.random.rand()

def get_next_state(state, action):
    # State transition function
    return (state + action) % len(states)

# Q-Learning algorithm
for episode in range(episodes):
    state = np.random.choice(states)
    for _ in range(100):  # Max steps per episode
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action = np.random.choice(actions)  # Explore
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state, :])  # Exploit

        next_state = get_next_state(state, action)
        reward = get_reward(state, action)

        # Update Q-value
        best_next_action = np.argmax(Q[next_state, :])
        Q[state, action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * Q[next_state, best_next_action] - Q[state, action])

        state = next_state
